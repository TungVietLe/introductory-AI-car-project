# introductory-AI-car-project
A beginner project I built while learning how to create a simple neural network using JavaScript with no libraries. In this course I learn to make a self-driving car simulation by implementing every component step-by-step, such as implement the car driving mechanics, how to define the environment, how to simulate some sensors, how to detect collisions, and how to make the car control itself using a neural network.
